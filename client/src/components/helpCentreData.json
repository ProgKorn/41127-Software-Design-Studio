        "content": "Introduction This User Manual (UM) provides the information necessary for students and examiners to effectively use the Sentinel web application which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) software to prevent misconduct during exams. This application aims to enable examiners to detect misconduct easily and allow students to perform their respective exams while being monitored in the easiest way possible. The scope of this application was to deliver a web-based application to schools that could revitalise the way schools hold their online exams. Given this scope, the main requirements that the business analyst was able to derive from the perspective of both the students and the examiners includes the following: To be able to verify the student’s identity upon login. To flag any incidents of misconduct during an exam. To be able to terminate a student’s exam when there are two flagged incidents. To keep a log of incidents for each exam. To keep full-length videos of students where misconduct was not detected. In the event of a system or software update (including bug fixes and the creation of additional features), newer versions of this user manual will be released to keep up with these changes. Because the student’s camera feed and all user information (including that of the examiner) is being stored, it is essential to have privacy protection software. All video information stored on the database will be encrypted and will require user authentication. Passwords stored on the system will be salted and password complexity will also be enforced. Data privacy and protection is at the core of the Sentinel AI Cheating Detection Software."

        "content": "Overview The Sentinel Web-Based Application is an AI Anti-Cheating Detection Software that was created to facilitate online exams and detect cheating incidents with ease. Our system integrates features that are separately accessible to both the students and the examiners. For the examiner side, this system will allow them to easily detect misconduct incidents and allow them to easily terminate an exam. They are also able to go back and review cheating incidents which will be stored on the database. This will reduce the need for constant monitoring on the examiners end and will ensure that students also have a fair assessment of their learning. Since the beginning of COVID-19, most if not all educational institutions have turned to online modes of learning. With the shift to online learning, students can more easily access information at their disposal than ever before. However, this means that they also have an opportunity to misuse data including using the internet and other resources to cheat during exams (Newton, 2023). Our aim in developing this product was to reduce cheating incidents and to ensure fairness and equality when taking online exams. In order to reduce wrongful termination during a student’s exam, the examiner has the ability to accept or decline the termination if two warnings are given. An extra exam log post exam will show the flagged incidents and allow the examiner to access the clip of the cheating incident. To use the system, the users will be authenticated based on the student/staff email address and password provided by the university. Conventions Figure 1 Introduction to Sentinel Figure 1 provides a high-level view of the student flagging process and how each component of our anti cheating system interacts with one another. Data is stored in the MongoDB Database which is hosted separately from the Sentinel System. The user uses the browser through the React Front-end design to interact with different pages of the system. The main functions of our system include but are not limited to: Login - There are two different logins for the student and examiner user. Each login will bring the user to different home screens with different access rights. Student Functionality View past examinations View scheduled proctored examinations Start a proctored examination session Test their equipment before the exam Examiner Functionality View a suspicious incident clip View recordings of all students who have completed the exam View the flagging log after the exam View exam schedule Schedule an Exam Start an Exam (and view the live feed from the exam) Manage classes Cautions & Warnings Security: The Sentinel system uses authentication measures, parses middleware and also has data secured in a secured database to ensure that all sensitive information is kept secure. Although password complexity is not enforced during login, users are encouraged to utilise complex passwords for additional account security. All login methods lead to different types of homepages depending on which user is currently signed in. Each account is secured with an email and a password that has been provided by the university and is unique to each user in our system. Utilising MongoDB to store user information ensures an increased information security because of the data encryption in the MongoDB software. Only authorised users can access the data stored in MongoDB. When paired with the password encryption and salting, the system provides a high level of system security. Tokenisation: The Sentinel application utilises tokenisation techniques to increase convenience and efficiency for the user utilising our application. Because tokenisation reduces the sign in attempts, the security of the account may be decreased. Users must be more vigilant about giving access to their device when signed into the Sentinel Application. Privacy Policy: Before the user begins their exam, they will be brought into an exam waiting room where they will have a Privacy Policy displayed on their screen with a tickbox. For the user to begin their exam, they must first accept the privacy policy. This ensures that the user is aware about the cautions and warnings associated with the Sentinel System."

        "title": "User Manual > Getting Started",
        "content": "Getting Started This Sentinel application is accessible through “Sentinel.com” through any browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome or Safari on any operating system of choice. Once the user has launched the website, they will be brought to the landing page to either visit the Help Centre or log into the Sentinel system. A screenshot of both the Landing page, Login pages and Home pages are placed below. After the user has entered the URL into their desired search browser, they will be brought to the homepage shown above. The user can choose the “Sign In” button to log into their account and view functions within the account. Once the user has placed their email, they will be redirected to their respective login page (student or admin login). The admin will be prompted to login with a username and password while the student login utilises facial login, reducing the risk of cheating incidence by increasing login complexity. The users will be brought to their respective homepages after successful login. Set-up Considerations The Sentinel system requires constant internet connection to continue using the system and to detect cheating instances accurately. To ensure that the internet is connected on an Apple MacBook, navigate to the wifi symbol located on the menu bar on your screen and connect to your desired internet network. This application is designed to access your camera and your microphone to detect instances of cheating. To optimise your access to Sentinel: Please enable pop-up blockers prior to attempting access to Sentinel. Enable the camera and microphone access on Chrome before accessing Sentinel by clicking on the lock button on the upper left hand corner of the navigation bar. Please use the button “Run System Test” on the Sentinel system to ensure that your device is working. User Access Considerations For the Sentinel software, there are two types of users that log into their specific homepage based on the corresponding user types: student and examiner. The two users have different home pages after login and have different functionality in each user type. Both accounts have the ability to view upcoming exams and previous exams (but are formatted differently). Examiners have the ability to schedule new exams, view suspicious clips of a student, view a flag log after an examination and terminate a student’s exams after two subsequent flags have been raised. Additionally, they are also able to view all students currently sitting the exam. The student access on the other hand is limited to exam access and does not have any of the examiner functionality except viewing exams. Accessing the Software To access the Sentinel software, there are two types of sign-in modes depending on the user type. The examiner login utilises an email and password login while the student login utilises facial recognition software to log in. If the examiner logging in does not have valid login details or if they have forgotten their login details, they must contact the institution’s information technology department to solve this issue and receive their login details. In the case of the student login, they must lodge an external form that will upload their facial data and landmarks into the system, enabling them to log in. Common issues relating to Facial Authentication for students will be in the Help Centre > Face Auth Troubleshoot. For privacy purposes, the users will not be allowed to change their login details directly on the Sentinel application. To easily contact the IT department, go to the Help Centre > Contact Us. Software Organization & Navigation For different types of users, there are different menu options or ways to navigate through the Sentinel system. When the user inputs the URL into their browser, they will be brought to the main page where they can choose to Sign In or view the Help Centre.

        "content": "The following subsections provide detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use the various functions or features of the Sentinel AI Anti-Cheating Detection Software. Login Students using the Sentinel web application can log into their user account which provides access to all features of the system that have been assigned to them. The purpose of creating the FaceID login method is to ensure that the student can be properly authenticated and reinforce the anti-cheating purpose of our software. For more information on accessing the system, please refer to Section 3: Getting Started. Student Homepage After logging into the system, the student will be brought to the student homepage where they can access functions such as viewing their student details and viewing upcoming  & previous exams. Figure 15  Student Homepage View Student Details When the user wants to view their current Student Details, they will be displayed on a table on the left-hand side of the screen. This table contains information such as the student’s first name, last name, student ID and email. Figure 16  Student Details Table. View Previous Exams When the user wants to view the previous exams that they have taken/joined, they can navigate to the table on the bottom of the screen which contains information such as the upcoming exams table above it. Figure 17  Previous Exams Table. View Upcoming Exams When the user wants to view their upcoming exams, they can navigate to the right-hand table of the screen which showcases the upcoming exams including the exam name, exam start, details and seat number. Figure 18  Upcoming Exams Table Access Exam When the student wants to join an exam session that they are scheduled for, they can click the “Access Exam” button on the Upcoming Exams table for the specific exam they want to join. This will redirect them into a waiting room before they begin the exam (exam session). Exam Session After the student selects the Access Exam button from the student homepage, they will be redirected first from the Exam Waiting Room (otherwise known as the Exam Start page) then to the actual proctored Exam Session. Exam Waiting Room (Exam Start Page) When inside the Exam Waiting Room, the student can view the details of the exam in the top table, they can then view the terms and conditions below. A scroll bar is available to view the content of the terms and conditions. Before being able to proceed they must agree to the terms and conditions by checking the box. Figure 19  Exam Start Page Pre-Exam Verification Before beginning the actual exam session, the student is required to scan their table for banned objects. This ensures that the student does not have any tools they can use for cheating that may not be detected during the exam. After the area has been scanned, the student can press the Continue button which will allow them to enter the exam session. Figure 20  Pre-Exam Verification Screen. Exam Session When the exam begins, the student is automatically moved from the waiting room to the exam session. During this session, object recognition and facial landmark detection runs to ensure that a student is not cheating during the examination. Figure 21  Exam Session Screen. Exam Flags As previously mentioned, once the exam begins, the anti-cheating software also begins. When a student commits any activities that are considered misconduct (as listed in Appendix G.7: Assumptions), they will be flagged by the system. An example of a flagging warning has been shown below. Figure 22  Sample of an Exam Flag. Exam Terminated When the student has received two flagging warnings, their exam session can be terminated (based on the manual approval of the examiner). If the exam session was terminated, the student will be redirected to this page below. From this page, they can go back to the student homepage. Figure 23  Exam Terminated Screen. Exam Complete After the exam has completed, the student will be redirected to an Exam Complete page where they will be redirected back to the student home page. Figure 24  Exam Complete Screen. View the Admin Dashboard Examiners using the Sentinel Web Application can log into their user account which provides access to all of the admin functions which will be outlined below. For more information on accessing the system, please refer to Section 3: Getting Started. Figure 25  Admin Dashboard Screen. The admin navigation bar, featured at the top of the dashboard (in addition to all administrative pages) features shortcuts to: The Home Page (see Figure 25) The Exam Schedule (see Figure 32) The Flag Log (see Figure 27) The Help Centre (see Figure 10) Launch Exam When the examiner selects the Launch Exam they will be directed to the active exam session. If there is no active exam session, this button is disabled. This allows for immediate access to a live exam session, which is particularly important for time-sensitive situations. Figure 26  Exam Session Screen for Admin. Student Monitoring/Flagging Figure 27  Flagged Incidents Screen. Flag Logs At the end of each examination, the examiner will be able to access the corresponding flagged incidents during the examination including the session name, examinee that was flagged, why the individual was flagged, the status of the flag, the flag number and the session number. The flag log automatically updates to show the complete list of flags have been registered to the system. The status column can show one of three status types as shown in Figure 27: Flagged Incidents Screen: The ‘resolved’ status indicates that the flag’s validity has been confirmed by an administrator and that the student has been successfully notified of the flag. The ‘pending’ status indicates that the flag has been logged, but is yet to be confirmed by an administrator. The ‘terminated’ status indicates that the flag has been dismissed by the administrator. This means that the student to whom the flag is addressed will receive no academic penalty. Flag dismissal can be awarded for one of two reasons: The automated flag-raising system has accidentally flagged behaviour that does not constitute academic misconduct. The student has been awarded special provisions by the administrator. Flag Details In the flagged incidents table, each flagged incident has a hyperlink attached to it that redirects the user to another page called Flag Details. This page is designed to provide more information about the flag including the examinee details, exam details, flag report and provides a clip of the flagged incident. Figure 28  Flag Details Screen. Create Session When the examiner selects the Create Exam button in the Admin Dashboard, they will be brought to the Create Session page where they can Schedule an Exam for the class. Information required to create a new exam session include specifying the date and duration, class name, exam name and description. Figure 29  Create Session Screen. Manage Classes When the examiner selects Manage Class, they will be directed to a page with a list of students allocated to their class. They are then able to add or remove the students in the class. Exams are scheduled to classes rather than to individual students; Administrators can use the ‘Manage Classes’ page  to configure the students expected to be in attendance of a particular exam by selecting which students they’d like to be in the exam. Figure 30  Manage Classes Screen. View Exam History When the examiner clicks on the Exam History button in the Admin Dashboard, they will be brought to the Exam History page where they can view the previous exams that they have scheduled/held. Information that is displayed on the table in Exam History include the exam name, Term, examiner name, number of attendees, exam start time, exam end time, status and session number. Figure 31  View Exam History Screen. View Schedule When the examiner enters the View Schedule screen they will be able to see any upcoming examinations. The first exam on the screen will be the exam closest to the current date. The examiner will be able to view the exam name, exam time and date as well as Exam Id. Figure 32  View Schedule Screen. Examiners may click the Show Exam Details link which will provide more details regarding the exam when clicked. Four buttons will also be visible, the Launch button, View Class button, Edit button and Delete button. When the examiner selects Launch they will be directed to the Exam Session and be able to view all the students partaking in the exam in real-time. When the examiner selects View Class, they will be able to see the list of students assigned to the exam. When the examiner selects Edit, they will be directed to a page where they will be able to edit any details of the exam, including the exam title and times.

        "content": "There are several logging processes and remediation actions embedded into Sentinel to enable a smooth and easy user experience across the site. These error messages have been detailed with the process, description, and where necessary, the remediation strategy for better observability and smoother user experience. User acceptance testing and integration testing has been used to identify defects and verify functionality, however as Sentinel is currently in beta, we are open to bug fix and feature enhancement suggestions from users. Error Message Location Context Remediation “Internal Server Error” Across the Site This error usually indicates connectivity issues to the backend from either severed connections, latency and loading issues, or deployment misconfigurations. Raise a ticket with Sentinel and the developers will investigate whether the server requires a restart or configuration change. “Login failed: Invalid credentials” Admin and Student Login Forms There is a mismatch between username/email and password (or facial data). The username does exist. Enter the correct password and ensure facial data is being used against the correct username/email. If the password has been forgotten, contact the university. “Login failed: User not found” Admin and Student Login Forms The username/email does not exist in the database, and therefore, has not been registered to Sentinel by the university. Contact the university to register the correct email address to the user. “Login failed: Internal Server Error” Admin and Student Login Forms The backend server has failed or the post request did not go through in time. Raise a ticket with Sentinel and the developers will investigate whether the server requires a restart or permission change. “Login failed: Facial data does not match any existing users in the database” Student Login Forms The facial data from the webcam does not match the student ID photo of the corresponding user. Log in using the correct email address or retry the camera in brighter lighting. “Document not found or not updated” Student Exam The details relating to the video of the cheating behaviour either do not fully align or is a duplicate of an existing database entry. Ensure the student and cheating details are valid and are unique. If the issue persists, contact Sentinel. “Error saving video” Student Exam The video could not be saved due to a connectivity or database issue. Refresh the page and try again. Contact Sentinel administrators if the issue persists. “Error: An error occurred while searching for the student.” Class Details Page A student could either not be found or a database connection occurred. Ensure a valid student ID is inputted, refresh the page, or contact Sentinel if the issue persists. “Error: No Class Name Provided” Admin Create Class Page A class name was not provided when creating a class. Enter a class name into the form. “Error: No Subject Id Provided” Admin Create Class Page A subject ID has not been provided on the create class page. Enter a subject ID into the form. “Error: Subject Id not a number” Admin Create Class Page The type of the subject ID is not valid. Enter a numerical value as the subject ID. “Error encountered while saving form” Admin Create Session Page The form was unable to save due to network, validation, or loading issues. Check for validation errors, refresh, and attempt to resubmit. Error: Exam end time occurs before start time. Admin Create Session Page Error: No Exam Name Provided Admin Create Session Page Error: No Start Time Provided Admin Create Session Page Error: No End Time Provided Admin Create Session Page An end time has not been provided in the create session page. Add a valid end time. “You do not have permission to access this page” No Access page The user is either not logged on or does not have the correct permissions to view the page. Log in with an account corresponding to the correct user role to view content. Certain special considerations have been made, particularly as the system is in early stages of development and user acceptance testing is still in progress. On rare occasions, a user will be presented with a “No Access” screen despite logging in successfully under an account with correct privileges. This is due to the request processing quickly that the token cannot be read before the component is loaded. A simple page refresh will remediate this. Although Sentinel has done due diligence in troubleshooting major bugs, dynamic systems and unique user interactions may still result in errors arising. Since the system is enabled by tertiary education institutions, support relating to password resets, examination queries, and flagging negotiations are directed to the relevant institution through the contact page linked in the top-right side of ribbon. For the table below, the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) was taken as an example due to the initial beta rollout being for staff and students at UTS.

        "content": "The Sentinel application utilises a Machine Learning Model to detect certain patterns and behaviours as 'cheating'. This involves running a script that analyses frames from the real-time video provided by the webcam each interval; for this system, is every ~5ms. In the event a 'cheating' behavious is detected by the system, the admin overseeing the exam session is notified of the event, being provided a short recorded clip of the detecetd behaviour. Figure 1: Student misconduct requireing approval, admin perspective. If the admin verifies the flagged behaviour is a valid cheating instance, the student is notified and promptly warned of their misconduct. Figure 2: Student misconduct flag, student perspective. The Machine Learning model analyses frames from the webcam to detect cheating through two methodologies, objection recognition analysis and facial landmark analysis. Object cheating behaviours. The script interprets all objects in the camera feed, and raises a flag if any banned items are detected. These include: Mobile phone, laptop, keyboard, and mouse. This aligns with the criteria, whereby a student should only have a pen, paper, eraser and calculator at any given time. Figure 3: Example mobile phone detection frame. This model also raises a flag if more than one person is present in the frame; only the student being examinated should be present at all times.Facial Landmark Behaviours. The script identifies facial landmarks and draws a mesh over the student's face, comparing these in real-time to determine if two key events occur: If the student turns their head away from the screen. If the student looks away from the designated exam screen. These behaviours have been identified as key indicators of a student engaging in suspicious activities, as this suggest the student is viewing content through an external source.
